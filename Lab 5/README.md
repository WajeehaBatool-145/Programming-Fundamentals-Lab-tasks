1️⃣ Bank Withdrawl Balance Checker
This program allows the user to enter their account balance and a withdrawal amount. 
It uses an `if-else` statement to check whether the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to the available balance.
If sufficient funds are available, the program calculates and displays the remaining balance; otherwise, it shows an insufficient balance message. 
This example helps beginners understand conditional statements and basic banking calculations in C++. 💰🏦

2️⃣ Payroll Calculation Program
This program calculates an employee's net salary based on their grade and years of experience.
It includes basic salary, bonus, and tax deductions to provide a complete payroll summary. 💵📊

3️ Student Grading Program
This program takes a student’s marks out of 100 as input and displays the corresponding grade.
It uses conditional statements to classify the marks into A+, A, B, C, or Fail. 
This helps beginners understand decision-making and conditional logic in C++. 📝🎓

4️⃣ Loan Eligibility Checker
This program determines whether a person is eligible for a loan based on their salary and work experience.
If the salary is at least 25,000, the user is automatically eligible; otherwise, eligibility depends on having more than 5 years of experience. 
This example helps beginners understand nested `if-else` statements and real-life decision-making scenarios. 💳✅

5️⃣ Traffic Signal Indicator
This program tells the user what action to take based on the color of a traffic signal entered as input.
It uses conditional statements to display "Stop" for red, "GO" for green, and "Slow down" for yellow. 
This example helps beginners practice `if` conditions and understand simple decision-making logic. 🚦🛑✅

6️⃣ Even Number Checker
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is even. 
It uses an `if` statement and the modulus operator (`%`) to determine divisibility by 2.
This example helps beginners understand conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations. 🔢⚖️

7️⃣ Positive Number Checker
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is positive.
It uses an `if` statement to determine whether the number is greater than zero.
This example helps beginners practice conditional statements and basic number evaluation. ➕🔢

8️⃣ Greatest Number Finder
This program takes three integer inputs from the user and determines the greatest among them.
It uses `if` statements with logical conditions to compare the numbers. This example helps beginners practice decision-making and comparing multiple values in C++. 🔢🏆
