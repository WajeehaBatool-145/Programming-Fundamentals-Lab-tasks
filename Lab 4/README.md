 1️⃣ Age group classification:
This program takes the user’s age as input and determines the appropriate age category.
It uses the ternary (conditional) operator to classify the age as a child, teenager, or adult based on predefined conditions.
The program demonstrates how nested ternary operators can be used to make decisions in a compact way.
This example helps beginners understand conditional logic and user input handling in C++. 🎯
