## 1️⃣ Age group classification:
This program takes the user’s age as input and determines the appropriate age category.
It uses the ternary (conditional) operator to classify the age as a child, teenager, or adult based on predefined conditions.
The program demonstrates how nested ternary operators can be used to make decisions in a compact way.
This example helps beginners understand conditional logic and user input handling in C++. 🎯

## 2️⃣ Even or Odd Number Checker:
This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd.
It uses the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if the number is divisible by 2.
The decision is made using the ternary (conditional) operator, making the code short and efficient. 
This program helps beginners practice conditional logic and basic arithmetic operations in C++.⚖️

## 3️⃣ Account Type and Special Offer Checker:

This program takes the user’s account balance as input and classifies the account as low balance, standard, or premium.
It uses nested ternary operators and logical conditions to determine the account type efficiently. 
The program also checks whether the user is eligible for a special offer based on account balance and loyalty status. 
This example helps beginners understand decision-making, logical operators, and real-life banking scenarios in C++. 💳🎯
